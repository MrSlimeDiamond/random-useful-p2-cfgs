Hide and seek thing

host on a ghost server (https://ghost.portal2.sr)

in the pre-launch options:
svar_set seeker SlimeDiamond; exec hideandseek/hideandseek; map pit_flings

replace seeker with whatever you want the seeker to be
replace map with whatever map you want it to be
its not random because i cant be bothered
seeker name might be case sensitive but idk lol

seeker has a 30 second cooldown until they can move or really do anything

have fun!
